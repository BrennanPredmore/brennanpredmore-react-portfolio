<h3>About me</h3>

 <img id="profile_image" src="./assets/brennan.jpg" alt="me" height="200px" width="201px"/>


 <p>
   Brennan is a former music teacher that is a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin - Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp.
   He is originally from Rochester, New York and moved to Austin six years ago after he graduated from a music education
   program.
   He hopes to become a full stack software developer/engineer one day and change the world around him!
   <br/>
   He found love in coding and learning new languages shortly after graduating school.
   Brennan had been bilingual from birth knowing Italian and english as his primary languages.
   As time went on in his programming studies, Brennan began to notice the similarities between creating musical
   notation and writing code.
   <br />
   They both demanded a lot of discipline, strict rules, and creativity to construct your final content.
   Ever since Brennan was child he wanted to create and change the world around him.
   Brennan had a very strong urge to share the knowledge he had learned through his own music education as well as
   software development with others around him.
   Once he graduated college Brennan began teaching privately for 5 years at a school in north Austin.
   He was instructing all ages in percussion, music theory/composition and piano during that time.
   He has also played in numerous successful bands all over the country and is still currently gigging around Texas.
   Brennan has a strong emphasis on technique and learning the fundamentals of any of his chosen fields of study.

   "I work and practice very hard alongside my peers to achieve any goal we set out to accomplish.
   I personally believe that if I am learning, having fun, and my team is with me every step of the way, we will in
   turn be successful!"
