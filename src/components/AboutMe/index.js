<h3>About me</h3>

 <img id="profile_image" src="./assets/brennan.jpg" alt="me" height="200px" width="201px"/>


 <p>
 I am a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin - Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp. Originally from Rochester, New York
  I moved to Austin six years ago after I graduated from a music education program. With proven success in the field, I’ve become a 
  full stack software engineer and continue to change the world around me!
   <br/>
   I found love in coding and learning new languages shortly after graduating music school. I had also been bilingual from birth knowing 
   Italian and English as my primary languages. As time went on in my programming studies, I began to notice the similarities between creating 
   musical notation, learning other languages and writing code.
   <br/>
   After many years of hard work and schooling I was able to learn many different languages and frameworks along the way including but not 
   limited to: JavaScript, React.js, React-Native, Redux, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JQuery, MySQL, Node.js, Heroku, Git, CRUD operations, 
   RESTful API’s, MongoDB, and PWA. I still continue to strive to learn more and sharpen my skills.
   <br />
   They all demanded a lot of discipline, strict rules, and creativity to construct your final content. Ever since I was child I wanted to 
   create and use my curiosity to learn and grow. I had a very strong urge to share the knowledge I’d learned through my own music education 
   as well as software development with others. Once I graduated college I began teaching privately for 5 years at a school in north Austin. 
   I was instructing all ages in percussion, music theory/composition and piano during that time. 
   <br />
   I have also played in numerous successful bands all over the country and is still currently gigging around Texas. I have a strong emphasis 
   on technique and learning the fundamentals of any of his chosen fields of study.
 <br />
 "I work and practice very hard alongside my peers to achieve any goal we set out to accomplish. I personally believe that if I am learning, 
 having fun, and my team is with me every step of the way, we will in turn be successful!"
